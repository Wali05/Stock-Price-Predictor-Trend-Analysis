# Stock Price Predictor & Trend Analysis

A powerful stock prediction web app that utilizes historical data and machine learning to forecast future stock prices. The app is built using Streamlit and leverages an LSTM model for accurate predictions. The interface is designed to be intuitive and user-friendly.

## Features
- **Price Forecasts**: Provides expected stock prices for the next week, month, and year.
- **Interactive Visualization**: Displays stock price trends with moving averages (100-day and 200-day) to help with technical analysis.
- **Data Analysis**: Comprehensive statistics about the stock data, including key metrics and historical performance.
- **Elegant Design**: Offers a clean and professional look with a theme toggle for both light and dark modes.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: Core programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Streamlit**: Framework for building the web interface.
- **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: Machine learning model used for stock price prediction.
- **Matplotlib**: Library for visualizing the stock data and trends.
- **Yahoo Finance API**: For fetching real-time stock data.

## How to Use
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   git clone https://github.com/Wali05/stock-price-predictor.git
   
2. Install Required Packages: Make sure you have Python installed. Then, navigate to the project directory and install the dependencies using:   
   pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the App: Start the Streamlit app by running:     streamlit run app.py
   
4. Enter the Stock Ticker: In the app interface, enter the stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL for Apple) to analyze and predict its future prices.
   
Installation
